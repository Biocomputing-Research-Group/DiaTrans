## Installation

	


## Dataset

## Transformer-DIA usage

### Step 0: Data Preparation 
- Split each dataset into train set, validation set, and test set
- Annotate the spectra file with the corresponding label extracted from feature file
- Create a new feature file 



### Step 1: Run de novo sequencing with a pre-trained model:

    


### Step 2: Evaluate de novo sequencing results:

    

### Step 3: Train a new model:
